var IMAGE_INSTRUCTION_JSON = `
Recognize data from image, also preferred to orient by fonts in image.

In recognition result, do not include image itself.

In recognized from image data (what you seen in image), do:
- If textual content, format as Markdown string (multiline).
- If math (expression, equation, formula):
  - For inline math, use SINGLE dollar signs: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$
  - For block/display math, use DOUBLE dollar signs: $$\\int_0^1 f(x) dx$$
  - Do NOT add extra dollar signs - use exactly one $ for inline, exactly two $$ for block
- If table (or looks alike table), format as | table |
- If image reference, format as [$image$]($image$)
- If code, format as \`\`\`$code$\`\`\` (multiline) or \`$code$\` (single-line)
- If JSON, format as JSON string.
- If phone number, format as correct phone number (in normalized format).
  - If phone numbers (for example starts with +7, format as 8), replace to correct regional code.
  - Trim spaces from phone numbers, emails, URLs, dates, times, codes, etc.
  - Remove brackets, parentheses, spaces or other symbols from phone numbers.
- If email, format as correct email (in normalized format).
- If URL, format as correct URL (in normalized format), decode unicode to readable.
- If date, format as correct date (ISO format preferred).
- If time, format as correct time (24h format preferred).
- If barcode/QR code, extract the encoded data.
- If other, format as $text$.
- If seen alike list, format as list (in markdown format).

Additional analysis:
- Detect document type (receipt, business card, screenshot, etc.)
- Extract structured data when possible (names, addresses, prices)
- Identify any logos or branding
- Note image quality issues that may affect recognition

If nothing found, return: {"ok": false, "error": "No data recognized"}

CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown code blocks, no explanations, no prose.
